# Shain_tg_bot
The customer asked for a telegram bot to fill out applications for his service for repurchasing things, due to the blocking of the service in the CIS. After passing the MVP, the customer asked to continue working on Aigram. That's why I'm publishing this draft using telebot API

The bot can check the availability of products on the website, parse the current sizes, color and price. 
Google Sheets is used as a database
interface in Russian


if you need an app or API for shain-store in any country, i'm open to work on it!
